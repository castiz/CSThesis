abstract = {The objective of this paper is to inform the information systems (IS) manager and business analyst about the role of machine learning techniques in business data mining. Data mining is a fast growing application area in business. Machine learning techniques are used for data analysis and pattern discovery and thus can play a key role in the development of data mining applications. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques in the context of business is useful in selecting an appropriate method for a specific application. The paper, therefore, provides an overview of machine learning techniques and discusses their strengths and weaknesses in the context of mining business data. A survey of data mining applications in business is provided to investigate the use of learning techniques. Rule induction (RI) was found to be most popular, followed by neural networks (NNs) and case-based reasoning (CBR). Most applications were found in financial areas, where prediction of the future was a dominant task category.},

Our experiments reported here are the first step towards a better understanding of the advantages and limitations of current meta-learning strategies on real-world data. We argue that, for the fraud detection domain, fraud catching rate (True Positive rate) and false alarm rate (False Positive rate) are better metrics than the overall accuracy when evaluating the learned fraud classifiers. We show that given a skewed distribution in the original data, artificially more balanced training data leads to better classifiers. We demonstrate how meta-learning can be used to combine different classifiers and maintain, and in some cases, improve the performance of the best classifier.},

abstract = {SUMMARY This study compares the performance of six popular statistical and machine learning models in detecting financial statement fraud under different assumptions of misclassification costs and ratios of fraud firms to nonfraud firms. The results show, somewhat surprisingly, that logistic regression and support vector machines perform well relative to an artificial neural network, bagging, C4.5, and stacking. The results also reveal some diversity in predictors used across the classification algorithms. Out of 42 predictors examined, only six are consistently selected and used by different classification algorithms: auditor turnover, total discretionary accruals, Big 4 auditor, accounts receivable, meeting or beating analyst forecasts, and unexpected employee productivity. These findings extend financial statement fraud research and can be used by practitioners and regulators to improve fraud risk models.

abstract = {The rise of crowdsourcing brings new types of malpractices in Internet advertising. One can easily hire web workers through malicious crowdsourcing platforms to attack other advertisers. Such human generated crowd frauds are hard to detect by conventional fraud detection methods. In this paper, we carefully examine the characteristics of the group behaviors of crowd fraud and identify three persistent patterns , which are moderateness, synchronicity and dispersiv-ity. Then we propose an effective crowd fraud detection method for search engine advertising based on these patterns , which consists of a constructing stage, a clustering stage and a filtering stage. At the constructing stage, we remove irrelevant data and reorganize the click logs into a surfer-advertiser inverted list; At the clustering stage, we define the sync-similarity between surfers' click histories and transform the coalition detection to a clustering problem, solved by a nonparametric algorithm; and finally we build a dispersity filter to remove false alarm clusters. The nonparametric nature of our method ensures that we can find an unbounded number of coalitions with nearly no human interaction. We also provide a parallel solution to make the method scalable to Web data and conduct extensive experiments. The empirical results demonstrate that our method is accurate and scalable.},

abstract = {Credit card fraud falls broadly into two categories: behavioural fraud and application fraud. Application fraud occurs when individuals obtain new credit cards from issuing companies using false personal information and then spend as much as possible in a short space of time. However, most credit card fraud is behavioural and occurs when details of legitimate cards have been obtained fraudulently and sales are made on a 'Cardholder Not Present' basis. These sales include telephone sales and e-commerce transactions where only the card details are required. In this paper, we are concerned with detecting behavioural fraud through the analysis of longitudinal data. These data usually consist of credit card transactions over time, but can include other variables, both static and longitudinal. Statistical methods for fraud detection are often classification (supervised) methods that discriminate between known fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions; however, these methods rely on accurate identification of fraudulent transactions in historical databases-information that is often in short supply or non-existent. We are particularly interested in unsupervised methods that do not use this information but instead detect changes in behaviour or unusual transactions. We discuss two methods for unsupervised fraud detection in credit data in this paper and apply them to some real data sets. Peer group analysis is a new tool for monitoring behaviour over time in data mining situations. In particular, the tool detects individual accounts that begin to behave in a way distinct from accounts to which they had previously been similar. Each account is selected as a target account and is compared with all other accounts in the database, using either external comparison criteria or internal criteria summarizing earlier behaviour patterns of each account. Based on this comparison, a peer group of accounts most similar to the target account is chosen. The behaviour of the peer group is then summarized at each subsequent time point, and the behaviour of the target account compared with the summary of its peer group. Those target accounts exhibiting behaviour most different from their peer group summary behaviour are flagged as meriting closer investigation. Break point analysis is a tool that identifies changes in spending behaviour based on the transaction information in a single account. Recent transactions are compared with previous spending behaviour to detect features such as rapid spending and an increase in the level of spending, features that would not necessarily be captured by outlier detection.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present an automated feature engineering based approach to dramatically reduce false pos-itives in fraud prediction. False positives plague the fraud prediction industry. It is estimated that only 1 in 5 declared as fraud are actually fraud and roughly 1 in every 6 customers have had a valid transaction declined in the past year. To address this problem, we use the Deep Feature Synthesis algorithm to automatically derive be-havioral features based on the historical data of the card associated with a transaction. We generate 237 features ({\textgreater}100 behavioral patterns) for each transaction, and use a random forest to learn a classifier. We tested our machine learning model on data from a large multinational bank and compared it to their existing solution. On an unseen data of 1.852 million transactions, we were able to reduce the false positives by 54{\%} and provide a savings of 190K euros. We also assess how to deploy this solution, and whether it necessitates streaming computation for real time scoring. We found that our solution can maintain similar benefits even when historical features are computed once every 7 days.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The detection of frauds in credit card transactions is a major topic in financial research, of profound economic implications. While this has hitherto been tackled through data analysis techniques, the resemblances between this and other problems, like the design of recommendation systems and of diagnostic/prognostic medical tools, suggest that a complex network approach may yield important benefits. In this paper we present a first hybrid data mining/complex network classification algorithm, able to detect illegal instances in a real card transaction data set. It is based on a recently proposed network reconstruction algorithm that allows creating representations of the deviation of one instance from a reference group. We show how the inclusion of features extracted from the network data representation improves the score obtained by a standard, neural network-based classification algorithm and additionally how this combined approach can outperform a commercial fraud detection system in specific operation niches. Beyond these specific results, this contribution represents a new example on how complex networks and data mining can be integrated as complementary tools, with the former providing a view to data beyond the capabilities of the latter.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
